<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3> The Mummy</h3>
<p> This is my favourite movie. I was a child when I first watched it </p>
<h3> The interview with the vampire </h3>
<p> I also loved this movie since I was a kid. A bit scary though </p>
<h3> The Mummy Returns</h3>
<p> Continuation of the Mummy, this one is also epic, worth watching </p>
